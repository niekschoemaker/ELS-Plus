### ELS-Plus

See: https://git.friendsincode.com/PFM/ELS-Plus/issues to submit an issue or use our discord here: . It is important that if you test ELS Plus for FiveM that you submit issues so that we may work to resolve these. Here's some things to consider:

- ELS vehicles are fully supported.
- Full VCF parsing so you can totally customize vehicles.
- Custom cars will require VCF files to be created by following the [How to add custom Vehicles](#how-to-add-els-vehicles-to-els-fivem) section.
- You can spawn a vehicle using /elscar {model}
- You can obtain a list of the vehicles ELS has detected by typing /elslist and pressing F8 to view console.(Plans to make menu in progress :D)

### Dependencies

This version of ELS-Plus is dependant on a custom version of baseevents which can be found here:
https://github.com/niekschoemaker/baseevents

This version shouldn't break any existing behaviour, only add to it.

2. In `__resource.lua` of that add-on/replace vehicle add the `VCF` xml file to the `files` list.
3. Make sure to validate the xml file to avoid issues with vehicle not showing up.
4. Add `is_els 'true'` to bottom of `__resource.lua`.
5. Restart Server
6. Profit

#### Important Notes
